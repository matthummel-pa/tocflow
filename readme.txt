A lightweight Table of Contents block that auto-generates a linked outline from your post headings.

== Description ==

TOCflow adds a single, focused Table of Contents block to the WordPress
block editor. Add it to any post and it automatically builds a linked outline
from your headings. The list is rendered on the server, so it appears in the
initial page HTML — good for SEO and accessibility — and it adds anchor IDs to
your headings for you.

Features:

* Auto-generates from H2/H3/H4 headings
* Choose which heading levels appear
* Numbered or bulleted list
* Accessible navigation landmark
* No configuration required to get started

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install it
   through the Plugins screen in WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen.
3. Add the "Table of Contents" block to a post that contains headings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with the classic editor? =

blocks from the post content.
